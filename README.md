# Twittter

This project is an attempt to mimic Twitter's functionality. It runs on Ruby 2.7.4, so make sure you have that installed and set up.

Once you clone the repo, run `bundle install` to install any gems that may be missing from your machine.

## Overview

Twittter is a Twitter clone, mimicking a lot of its functionality. Users sign up using Devise, and create posts that show up on a 'feed'. I added some tables on the left and right to mimic #trends and 'follow' suggestions. This is mostly a front-end project, however, and they don't lead somewhere.
